## Purpose

3EM was conceived as an alternate solution to [SmartWeave](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/SmartWeave) while still accomplishing the same goal: Simple & Scalable smart contracts on the Arweave protocol.

After receiving multiple feedback from different individuals and teams, we realize there were 3 main issues that needed to be solved:
- Speed
- Security
- Multi-language support

For more information on how we solved the issues mentioned above, please refer to our [technical guide](https://github.com/3distributed/3em/tree/main/docs/technical_guide.md).

## Benchmarks

According to our benchmarks, we have registered our lowest cold start for Javascript contracts at _0.8973357861200001_ seconds & our lowest average have been calculated at 0.43358682066.
