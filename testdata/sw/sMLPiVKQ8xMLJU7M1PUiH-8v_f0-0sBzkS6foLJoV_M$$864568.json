    "description": "The year 2020 is a bittersweet one for most people. I can’t speak for other people’s experiences of this horrible year. As for the me, I can say that I managed to find a semblance of peace through photography.  There’s something calming about working a camera to capture an image one pre-visualised.\n\nThis image speaks to me about hope. The hope of a new day which is always filled with amazing possibilities. The hope of a better day if the one before disappointed. The hope of a better future when the world felt bleak. The dawn signifies new beginnings and it is truly one of my favourite things to watch and be in awe of. I love looking at this image and be absorbed by the soothing blues and intrigued by vibrant glow in the horizon.\n\nThis image is permanently stored on Arweave: https://app.ardrive.io/#/file/b8b086ce-4b3e-4a02-b8d7-8861c56c803d/view ",
