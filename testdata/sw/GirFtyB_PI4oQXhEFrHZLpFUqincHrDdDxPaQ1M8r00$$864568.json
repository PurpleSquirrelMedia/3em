    "name": "Bark Blocks Series 1: Paperbark",
    "description": "Bark Blocks is a fine-art project inspired by nature and blockchain technology.\n\nSeries One is a collection of 1/1 images by Chris James (articulate.eth / filmplusdigital) made with the Melaleuca quinquenervia (Paperbark) tree, native to Eastern Australia.\n\nThe Paperbark is used in traditional medicine, cooking and building. Its fine soft bark gives a distinctive, fingerprint-like quality to its trunk.\n\n\"I have been fascinated by the unique bark patterns since childhood. These photos emerge from that fascination but also combine ideas from blockchain technology. Nature is the OG \"generative artist\". Each bark pattern is verifiably unique, similar and repetitive.\n\nThere is a fractal-like pattern to the photos that gives an experience reminiscent of watching an open fire. The more you look, the more you see. The volume of data contained in these natural blocks is immense and humbling.\"",
