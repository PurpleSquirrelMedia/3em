    "description": "Made with the legendary Leica M8, this image places innocuous light poles into heroic relief against the dawn.  The Leica sensor in combination with a vintage Rokkor lens gathers the light and colours in a very special way.  At any other time in the past decade this image might have been purely aesthetic, but in 2020 the black lines of the poles is reminiscent of the COVID-19 bar charts and graphs we've all been looking at relentlessly.  The glow of dawn in the distance promises imminent illumination and the hope of a new day.  \n\nThis image is permanently stored on Arweave: https://app.ardrive.io/#/file/3a172732-fc3b-4948-8c15-9c948fac7131/view",
