    "description": "This exceptional image was created with a vintage 4x5 Carbon Chroma Adventurer in 2020 by Bill Thoo.  Bill is a well-regarded night film photographer who is unafraid to push the limits of the technology.  This exceptionally rendered black and white photo was taken in the lee of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  Standing beneath this quiet unassuming arch there are very few clues about the huge, iconic, historic bridge you are looking at.  This serene image is a strong metaphor for the little moments during the pandemic when everything felt normal for a minute, even when the enormity of 2020 was right there in front of you.\n\nThis image is permanently available on Arweave: https://app.ardrive.io/#/file/7cd7b72e-0632-45c3-9d14-d061487c98db/view ",
